- ESP32 development board
- IR LED connected to GPIO 33

### Getting Started
1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork: `git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ACWebRemote.git`
3. Create a feature branch: `git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name`
4. Make your changes
5. Test your changes

## Code Style

### C++ Guidelines
- Use 4 spaces for indentation
- Follow the existing code style in the project
- Add comments for complex logic
- Keep functions focused and small

- `src/web_interface.cpp` - Web interface generation
- `lib/IRTadiran/` - IR library implementation

## Testing

### Before Submitting
1. Ensure your code compiles: `pio run`
2. Test on actual hardware if possible
3. Test the web interface on different devices
4. Verify WiFi setup and AC control functionality

### Hardware Testing
- Test WiFi configuration portal
- Verify AC commands work with your Tadiran unit
- Check web interface responsiveness
- Test mDNS resolution
